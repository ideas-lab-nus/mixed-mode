				<h2>What is <strong> mixed-mode </strong> ventilation?</h2>
				<p> “Mixed-mode” refers to a hybrid approach to space conditioning that uses a combination of natural ventilation from operable windows (either manually or automatically controlled), and mechanical systems that include air distribution equipment and refrigeration equipment for cooling.  </p>
				<p>Effective mixed-mode ventilation combines data fusion & integration, energy modelling & simulation as well as various machine learning approaches (i.e., deep reinforcement learning) to optimise building performance. </p>

				<h2>What are <strong>different types </strong> of mixed-mode ventilation?</h2>
				<p>There are 3 different types of mixed-mode. </p>
				<p> <strong> Concurrent: </strong> Concurrent mixed-mode operation is the most prevalent design strategy in practice today, in which the air-conditioning system and operable windows operate in the same space and at the same time.   </p>
				<p> <strong> Changeover: </strong> Change-over designs are becoming increasingly common, where the building “changes-over” between natural ventilation and air-conditioning on a seasonal or even daily basis. The air-conditioning system and operable windows operate in the same space and different times.  </p>
				<p> <strong> Zoned: </strong> Zoned systems are also common, where different zones within the building have different conditioning strategies. The air-conditioning system and operable windows operate in the different zones and times. </p>

				<h2>What are the <strong>different data sources</strong> used in occupant centric sensing and control strategy?</h2>
				<p> Different data sources includes Energy, Thermal, Acoustics, Indoor Air Quality, Wearables and Building Operation under various mixed-mode aspects. </p>
